          <h3>Why do turtles hatch?</h3>
          <p>
            In summertime when the weather is warm, pregnant female sea turtles
            return to the beaches where they themselves hatched years before.
            They swim through the crashing surf and crawl up the beach searching
            for a nesting spot above the high water mark. Using her back
            flippers, the reptile digs a nest in the sand. Digging the nest and
            laying her eggs usually takes from one to three hours, after which
            the mother turtle slowly drags herself back to the ocean.
          </p>

          <p>
            The sea turtle lays up to 100 eggs, which incubate in the warm sand
            for about 60 days. The temperature of the sand determines the
            genders of baby sea turtles, with cooler sand producing more males
            and warmer sand producing more females. The phenomenon is called
            Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination, or TSD, and governs the
            genders of other reptiles, too, including alligators and crocodiles.
            Current NOAA research suggests that warming trends due to climate
            change may cause a higher ratio of female sea turtles, potentially
            affecting genetic diversity.

          <h3>Reaching the Ocean</h3>
          <p>
            There are several theories as to how hatchlings find the sea.
            Hatchlings may discriminate light intensities and head for the
            greater light intensity of the open horizon. During the crawl to the
            sea, the hatchling may set an internal magnetic compass, which it
            uses for navigation away from the beach. When a hatchling reaches
            the surf, it dives into a wave and rides the undertow out to sea.
          </p>
          <p>
            A "swim frenzy" of continuous swimming takes place for about 24 to
            48 hours after the hatchling enters the water. This frantic activity
            gets the young turtle into deeper water, where it is less vulnerable
            to predators. There have been reports of swimming hatchlings diving
            straight down when birds and even airplanes appear overhead. This
            diving behavior may be a behavioral adaptation for avoiding
            predation by birds. Past the surf zone, hatchlings use their
            internal magnetic compass for orientation.

          <h3>The "Lost Years"</h3>
          <p>
            After entering the ocean, the hatchlings of many species of sea
            turtles are rarely seen for 1 to 3 years. These are referred to as
            the “lost years.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Researchers generally agree that most hatchlings spend their first
            few years living an oceanic existence before appearing in coastal
            areas. Although the migratory patterns of the young turtles during
            the first year has long been a puzzle, most researchers believe that
            they ride prevailing surface currents, situating themselves in
            floating seaweed where they are can find food. These researchers
            also suggests that flatback hatchlings do not go through an oceanic
            phase. Evidence shows that the young turtles remain inshore
            following the initial swim frenzy. Most remain within 15 km (9.3
            miles) of land.

        <h3>Why Care About Sea Turtles?</h3>
        <p>
          Much can be learned about the condition of the planet’s environment by
          looking at sea turtles. They have existed for over 100 million years,
          and they travel throughout the world’s oceans. Suddenly, however, they
          are struggling to survive — largely because of things people are doing
          to the planet’s oceans and beaches. But what does this mean for the
          human species?It is possible that a world in which sea turtles can not
          survive may soon become a world in which humans struggle to survive.
          If, however, we learn from our mistakes and begin changing our
          behavior, there is still time to save sea turtles from extinction. In
          the process, we will be saving one of the earth’s most mysterious and
          time-honored creatures. We might just be saving ourselves too.
        </p>

            To truly protect sea turtles around the world, many different
            countries and cultures must cooperate and share responsibility.
            International laws and agreements, research, and the work of
            dedicated organizations and individuals each must play a part.
            Long-term protection of sea turtles also means developing solutions
            that reduce reliance on management methods requiring direct human
            involvement — such as moving nests or raising hatchlings in
            captivity. If sea turtles can not survive and reproduce on their
            own, without help from humans, then they are doomed. Feeding and
            nesting grounds must be protected, and a public wildlife
            conservation ethic must be fostered that can withstand gaps in
            government regulations, pressure from private interests, and changes
            in the political climate.<br class="don-text" />donate or adopt
